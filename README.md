# bouncing-chains

Killer Sudoku Solver written in C, and DLX written in Python 3

Accepts *N*x*N* inputs, snazzy printing out as it solves the puzzle (assuming it's valid).

Currently intending to implement Donald Knuth's Algorithm X based on the 'Dancing Links' algorithm, hence the silly repo name.
